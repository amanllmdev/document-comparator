# Document-comparator
This project is a simple yet powerful AI-based document comparison tool built with Gemini 1.5 Flash and Streamlit. It allows you to upload two .txt files and uses Googleâ€™s Gemini model to generate a side-by-side comparison, highlighting key differences in content, tone, and structure.
